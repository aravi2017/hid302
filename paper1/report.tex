\begin{abstract}
This paper provides insight into how big data can be used in the restaurant industry. It also explores how big data can be collected and analyzed so that it helps restaurant industry to do better in profit margins and give their customer a great hospitality experience. This paper will try to find out current technologies and solutions available in big data processing for the restaurant industry. It will also focus on various challenges involved in using big data in the restaurant business.

\section{Introduction}
Big data is revolutionizing the way business is getting conducted in various industries. The retailer like Amazon uses it to provide personalized buying suggestions and social networking site like LinkedIn uses it to connect more people. Question is, do we have big data available for the restaurant industry and how big data application is going to be beneficial. The restaurant industry is facing challenges like shrinking labor pool, moderate economic growth, costly labor, challenging profit margin, high competition, moderate sales growth and growing expectation from the customer on the dining experience, can big data application help overcome these challenges.\cite{www-restaurant-challenges}


\section{Big Data for Restaurant/Ingredient}
To understand how big data analytics will help, we first need to find out what are the data points present in the restaurant industry which can be considered as big data. As one of the V-variety of big data, the restaurant also has structured and unstructured data. Structured data is something which is getting generated inside the restaurant and unstructured data is something which is outside of the restaurant.
\subsection{Structured Data}
Structured data is well formatted, easy to understand and analyze. Restaurant POS(point of sale) system shows whatâ€™s selling, where, and at what time\cite{www-qsr}. Food and beverage cost, labor cost, product mix, rent cost are obvious data points. Raw material required for preparation, menu, ingredient consideration, meal preparation, product availability from the supplier, prices of products comes from the kitchen of the restaurant. Staffing schedule, table turnover, bar management, wages, salaries, tips, customer feedback is data. The number of time employee coming late, number of times drinks provided as comp due to server error is data.\cite{www-restaurant}
\subsection{Unstructured Data}
Unstructured data is un-formatted, difficult to gather and analyze. Data shared from social media like trends, retweets, shares, and comments categorize as unstructured data. Customer promotions, customer profile like age, gender, address, email, taste preference, favorite dish, various milestones like birthdate, anniversary etc, along with family information is also an unstructured data. Weather and traffic information also constitutes as an important data to consider. \cite{www-restaurant}


\section{Collect Big Data/Consume}
These various data attributes can be collected from the different system. Most of the data is generated inside the restaurant by the system like POS which captures all sales transactions. POS system can also break down sales by time, size of the party, menu items, and ingredients. The inventory provides information on suppliers, food, beverages, and gas and electricity bill. Payroll provides information on wages, salaries, employee schedule, and time off by the employees. Loyalty program and marketing promotions provides data regarding marketing of the restaurant.


Outside data can be gathered through the various applications like OpenTable, Facebook, Twitter, Yelp, TripAdvisor, Foursquare, Urbanspoon or Instagram, weather and traffic sites. Information can be gathered from customer like his favorite menu/drink item, favorite table, special request, allergies, liking to the presentation, feedback on ambiance, service and food. \cite{www-restaurant}

\section{Conclusions}

This paragraph will end the body of this sample document.  Remember
that you might still have Acknowledgments or Appendices; brief samples
of these follow.  There is still the Bibliography to deal with; and we
will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception of the
reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in this paper are to
articles which have nothing to do with the present subject and are
used as examples only.

\section{Headings in Appendices}

The rules about hierarchical headings discussed above for the body of
the article are different in the appendices.  In the \textbf{appendix}
environment, the command \textbf{section} is used to indicate the
start of each Appendix, with alphabetic order designation (i.e., the
first is A, the second B, etc.) and a title (if you include one).  So,
if you need hierarchical structure \textit{within} an Appendix, start
with \textbf{subsection} as the highest level. Here is an outline of
the body of this document in Appendix-appropriate form:

\subsection{Introduction}
\subsection{The Body of the Paper}
\subsubsection{Type Changes and  Special Characters}
\subsubsection{Math Equations}
\paragraph{Inline (In-text) Equations}
\paragraph{Display Equations}
\subsubsection{Citations}
\subsubsection{Tables}
\subsubsection{Figures}
\subsubsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
\subsubsection*{A Caveat for the \TeX\ Expert}
